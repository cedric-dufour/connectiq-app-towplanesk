TowplaneSK (Garmin ConnectIQ) App
=================================
Usage instructions


   !!! WARNING !!! DISCLAIMER !!! WARNING !!! DISCLAIMER !!! WARNING !!!

   THIS APPLICATION IS NOT TO BE USED AS A MEAN TO INSURE FLIGHT SAFETY.

  Always follow official or recommended procedures to insure flight safety,
         *independently* from the help this application can offer.

  In particular, this application relies on barometric pressure to derive
  the altitude and MUST NOT BE USED IN A PRESSURIZED AIRCRAFT.

   !!! WARNING !!! DISCLAIMER !!! WARNING !!! DISCLAIMER !!! WARNING !!!


Foreword
--------

TowplaneSK relies on your device's raw barometric sensor to compute the altitude,
using the ad-hoc International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) formulas and
according to the International Standard Atmosphere (ISA).

Consequently, you MUST calibrate TowplaneSK internal altimeter - using either
the known QNH or elevation (see Settings below) - to obtain an accurate
altitude reading (the device's "native" altimeter/barometer settings are
ignored).


Timer View
----------

The Timer view tracks your current flight times:
 - Top-Left:
   Off-Block time
 - Top-Right:
   Takeoff time
 - Left:
   Block time (elapsed)
 - Center:
   <-> Towplane callsign
   <-> Glider callsign
   <-> Cycles (landings/touch-'n-go) count
 - Right:
   Flight time (elapsed)
 - Bottom-Left:
   On-Block time
 - Bottom-Right:
   Landing time

The BACK button allows you to control the Timer (depending on the flight phase):
 - Reset
 - Save (add Log entry and Activity lap)
 - Discard
 - Add Cycle
 - Undo Cycle
 - Exit (the application)


Speed View
----------

The Speed view shows the current:
 - Top-Left:
   optimal Tow Speed
 - Top-Right:
   Flight Time
 - Left:
   Vertical Speed
 - Center:
   <-> Towplane callsign
   <-> Glider callsign
 - Right:
   Altitude
 - Bottom-Left:
   <-> Ground Speed
   <-> Air Speed
 - Bottom-Right:
   Heading

The Left/Center/Right fields will turn (bright) RED - along vibrate and sound
alarm - in case the current Temperature is above the configured threshold (see
Settings -> Temperature -> Alert below).

Otherwise, it will turn ORANGE - also along vibrate and sound alarm - in case
the current Altitude is above the configured threshold (see Settings -> Altimeter
-> Alert below).

Note the *estimated* Air Speed is displayed only when On-Block and used only
to detect Take-Off and Landing more acurately based on configured wind
conditions (see Settings -> Wind below).


Altimeter View
--------------

The Altimeter view displays current:
 - Top-Left:
   Density Altitude
 - Top-Right:
   Temperature
 - Left:
   Altitude
 - Center:
   Offset to standard (ISA) temperature
 - Right:
   QNH (standard pressure at sea level)
 - Bottom-Left:
   Pressure Altitude (flight level)
 - Bottom-Right:
   QFE (ambient pressure)

The Left/Center/Right fields will turn (bright) RED - along vibrate and sound
alarm - in case the current Temperature is above the configured threshold (see
Settings -> Temperature -> Alert below).

Otherwise, it will turn ORANGE - also along vibrate and sound alarm - in case
the current Altitude is above the configured threshold (see Settings -> Altimeter
-> Alert below).


Towplane View
--------------

The Towplane view displays the chosen airplane characteristics:
 - Top-Left:
   Empty Weight

   (depending on wether a Glider is being towed)
 - Bottom-Left:
   current Fuel Quantity
   (decreasing according to the configured Fuel Flow)
 - Bottom-Right:
   current Fuel Flow

The entire background will turn (dark) RED, across all "live" views - along
virbrate and sound alarm - in case the Fuel Quantity is below the configured
Fuel threshold (see Fuel -> Alert below).

The Left/Center/Right fields will turn:
 - (bright) RED in case the current Total Weight is greater that the Maximum Takeoff
   Weight (MTOW)
 - ORANGE if it is within 5% of the MTOW
 - (dark) GREEN otherwiser

About Data Filtering
--------------------

TowplaneSK uses 5-second median filtering to smooth out the sensors jitter.

This induces a 5-second "warm-up" time before any flight data are displayed
after GPS signal is (re-)acquired.

This also means the various sensor readings (speed, altitude, etc.) will have
a 2-second *average* delay.


Importing Storage Data
----------------------

TowplaneSK allows you to import data into the application storage space - iow.
Towplanes or Gliders library - from the web; to do so:

1. connect your device to Garmin Connect Mobile (GCM) via Bluetooth

2. [optional] use GCM to edit the Repository URL (TowplaneSK application) setting;
   by default:

     https://github.com/cedric-dufour/connectiq-app-towplanesk/raw/master/data

3. use the Import Data setting (see Setting above) to specify the JSON data file
   name to download from the repository, without the .json suffix; example given:

     SAMPLE

   WARNING! Make sure your GCM phone/tablet doesn't go to sleep while performing
   this step or it won't allow GCM to relay the data to your watch.

The destination slot(s) will then be updated (overwritten!) based on the data
contained in the file.

The format of a JSON destination data file is straight-forward; example given:

     https://github.com/cedric-dufour/connectiq-app-towplanesk/raw/master/data/SAMPLE.json

Provided you have some web service where to store them, you can write your own
data file(s). Just edit the Repository URL correspondingly (see point 2. above).
WARNING: If using HTTPS (SSL), make sure the website's certificate is from a
well-known Certification Authority (CA) or GCM will refuse to download the data.


Calibrating the Device Sensor
-----------------------------

TowplaneSK allows you to calibrate/correct your device's barometric sensor using
the following formulas:

   QFEcalibrated = QFEsensor * Crel + Cabs

If you suspect your device's sensor is inaccurate, you shall:

1. install the PilotAltimeter widget to access the device's *QFE* readings
   (unfortunately, this falls out of TowplaneSK scope/purpose)

2. take down multiple QFE readings, at different altitude, using your device's
   *raw* QFE and a reliable, calibrated, reference barometer

3. import those readings in a LibreOffice Calc (or Microsoft Excel) spreadsheet
   and obtain the Crel and Cabs coefficients by performing a linear regression:

     https://help.libreoffice.org/Calc/Regression_Analysis
     where Crel = Slope and Cabs = Intercept

   (curve-fitting for dummies: https://xkcd.com/2048/)

4. set Altimeter -> Correction -> Relative/Absolute values to the calculated
   coefficients

Not an easy feat. But if you must...


WARNING!!! GOTCHAS!!!
---------------------

When using GPS devices, you should be aware that:
 - GPS is very accurate for location (latitude/longitude) information; even
   more so when coupled with GLONASS/GALILEO (at the cost of battery usage).
 - (Garmin) UltraTrac feature is very cool to save battery but does NOT
   refresh location information frequently enough for TowplaneSK purpose.

      !!! DO NOT USE ULTRATRAC WITH TOWPLANESK !!!

The ConnectIQ framework does NOT allow applications - like TowplaneSK - to
control the location source (GPS, GLONASS and/or UltraTrac). The only way
to circumvent that limitation is to

      !!! USE A NATIVE GARMIN APPLICATION BEFOREHANDS !!!

The ConnectIQ application launched afterwards will then retain those settings.
